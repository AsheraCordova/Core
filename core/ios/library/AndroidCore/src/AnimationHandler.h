 @brief This custom, static handler handles the timing pulse that is shared by all active
  ValueAnimators.This approach ensures that the setting of animation values will happen on the
  same thread that animations start on, and that all animations will share the same times for
  calculating their values, which makes synchronizing animations possible.
 The handler uses the Choreographer by default for doing periodic callbacks. A custom
  AnimationFrameCallbackProvider can be set on the handler to provide timing pulse that
  may be independent of UI frame update. This could be useful in testing.

 This is used to compensate expensive traversals that happen as the

  initial frame will be delayed (by a long time). But since the startTime of the
  animation is set before the traversal, by the time of next frame, a lot of time would
  have passed since startTime was set, the animation will consequently skip a few frames
  to respect the new frameTime. By having the commit time, we can adjust the start time to
  when the first frame was drawn (after any expensive traversals) so that no frames
  will be skipped.
