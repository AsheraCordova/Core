 @brief This subclass of <code>ValueAnimator</code> provides support for animating properties on target objects.
 The constructors of this class take parameters to define the target object that will be animated
  as well as the name of the property that will be animated. Appropriate set/get functions
  are then determined internally and the animation will call these functions as necessary to
  animate the property. 
 <p>Animators can be created from either code or resource files, as shown here:</p>
  
 development/samples/ApiDemos/res/anim/object_animator.xml ObjectAnimatorResources
  
 <p>Starting from API 23, it is possible to use <code>PropertyValuesHolder</code> and 
 <code>Keyframe</code> in resource files to create more complex animations. Using PropertyValuesHolders
  allows animators to animate several properties in parallel, as shown in this sample:</p>
  
 development/samples/ApiDemos/res/anim/object_animator_pvh.xml
  PropertyValuesHolderResources
  
 <p>Using IKeyframes allows animations to follow more complex paths from the start
  to the end values. Note that you can specify explicit fractional values (from 0 to 1) for
  each keyframe to determine when, in the overall duration, the animation should arrive at that
  value. Alternatively, you can leave the fractions off and the keyframes will be equally
  distributed within the total duration. Also, a keyframe with no value will derive its value
  from the target object when the animator starts, just like animators with only one
  value specified. In addition, an optional interpolator can be specified. The interpolator will
  be applied on the interval between the keyframe that the interpolator is set on and the previous
  keyframe. When no interpolator is supplied, the default <code>AccelerateDecelerateInterpolator</code>
  will be used. </p>
