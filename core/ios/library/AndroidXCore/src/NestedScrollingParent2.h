 @brief This interface should be implemented by <code>ViewGroup</code> subclasses
  that wish to support scrolling operations delegated by a nested child view.
 <p>Classes implementing this interface should create a final instance of a 
 <code>NestedScrollingParentHelper</code> as a field and delegate any View or ViewGroup methods
  to the <code>NestedScrollingParentHelper</code> methods of the same signature.</p>
  
 <p>Views invoking nested scrolling functionality should always do so from the relevant 
 <code>ViewCompat</code>, <code>ViewGroupCompat</code> or <code>ViewParentCompat</code> compatibility
  shim static methods. This ensures interoperability with nested scrolling views on all versions
  of Android.</p>

  given an opportunity to respond and claim the nested scrolling operation by returning 
 <code>true</code>.</p>
  
 <p>This method may be overridden by ViewParent implementations to indicate when the view
  is willing to support a nested scrolling operation that is about to begin. If it returns
  true, this ViewParent will become the target view's nested scrolling parent for the duration
  of the scroll operation in progress. When the nested scroll is finished this ViewParent
  will receive a call to <code>onStopNestedScroll(View, int)</code>.

 @brief React to a nested scroll in progress before the target view consumes a portion of the scroll.
 <p>When working with nested scrolling often the parent view may want an opportunity

  fully into view before the list itself begins scrolling.</p>

  report how any pixels of the scroll reported by dx, dy were consumed in the 
 <code>consumed</code> array. Index 0 corresponds to dx and index 1 corresponds to dy.
  This parameter will never be null. Initial values for consumed[0] and consumed[1]
  will always be 0.</p>
